# Quant_MonteCarlo
example of a Monte Carlo simulation project for options trading with machine learning predictions. This script involves simulating various scenarios of option prices using the Black-Scholes model for pricing and predicting future option prices using a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression).
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates stock prices over time based on random normal distributions and calculates potential option outcomes using the Black-Scholes formula.
Machine Learning: Trains a RandomForestRegressor to predict future stock prices using historical return data. We use Yahoo Finance's yfinance API to download historical stock data.
Option Pricing: Once the stock price is predicted using the machine learning model, we calculate the option price using the Black-Scholes formula for that predicted stock price.

Key Libraries:

    numpy: For numerical simulations.
    pandas: For handling stock data.
    yfinance: To get real stock data from Yahoo Finance.
    scikit-learn: To implement machine learning for stock price prediction.
    matplotlib: For visualizations of stock price paths and predictions.
