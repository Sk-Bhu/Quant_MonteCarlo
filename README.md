# Quant_MonteCarlo
example of a Monte Carlo simulation project for options trading with machine learning predictions. This script involves simulating various scenarios of option prices using the Black-Scholes model for pricing and predicting future option prices using a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression).
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulates stock prices over time based on random normal distributions and calculates potential option outcomes using the Black-Scholes formula.
Machine Learning: Trains a RandomForestRegressor to predict future stock prices using historical return data. We use Yahoo Finance's yfinance API to download historical stock data.
Option Pricing: Once the stock price is predicted using the machine learning model, we calculate the option price using the Black-Scholes formula for that predicted stock price.
Dataset:

    The yfinance library is used to fetch stock data (e.g., Apple stock). You can replace 'AAPL' with any other stock symbol to simulate predictions on other companies' stock prices.

Key Libraries:

    numpy: For numerical simulations.
    pandas: For handling stock data.
    yfinance: To get real stock data from Yahoo Finance.
    scikit-learn: To implement machine learning for stock price prediction.
    matplotlib: For visualizations of stock price paths and predictions.
